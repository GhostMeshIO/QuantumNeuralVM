# QuantumNeuralVM Open Innovation License

## Preamble: The Entanglement Principle

**Quantum Physics** teaches us that information is fundamental, and that entanglement creates correlations stronger than any classical connection. **Neural Networks** show us that intelligence emerges from distributed connections and shared knowledge. 

In this spirit, we release QuantumNeuralVM not merely as software, but as an **entangled intellectual resource**—a quantum of innovation meant to propagate through the scientific community, creating correlations between minds and enabling emergent discoveries.

## Article 1: Quantum State of Rights

### §1.1 Superposition of Permissions
You are granted a **quantum superposition** of rights to:
- **Use** this software in any state (academic, commercial, research)
- **Study** its source code as a wavefunction of knowledge
- **Modify** and **entangle** it with your own creations
- **Distribute** copies to create Bell pairs of collaboration
- **Sublicense** under compatible open quantum principles

### §1.2 Measurement Basis
When you **observe** (use) this software, you agree to:
1. **Preserve the quantum signature** (copyright notice) in all substantial superpositions (copies)
2. **Maintain coherence** by including this license in all entangled distributions
3. **Respect the no-cloning theorem** by not removing attribution from derived works

---

## Article 2: Quantum Entanglement of Knowledge

### §2.1 Bell State Collaboration
This software is offered in the spirit of **quantum entanglement**:
- **Local operations** (modifications) may change your local state
- **But the correlation** (shared knowledge) must remain non-local (open)
- **Teleportation** of concepts to new domains is encouraged
- **Superdense coding** (compressing complex ideas) requires attribution

### §2.2 Quantum Darwinism
The fittest ideas should survive environmental decoherence:
- **Mutate** this code through forks and variations
- **Select** for improvements through community review
- **Propagate** successful adaptations through the ecosystem
- **Preserve** the genetic lineage through proper attribution

---

## Article 3: Neural Network of Responsibility

### §3.1 Forward Propagation
The authors **forward propagate** this work with:
- **No hidden layers** of proprietary restrictions
- **Full gradient** of source code available
- **Activation function** set to "open collaboration"

### §3.2 Backpropagation of Credit
You must **backpropagate credit** through the network:
- **Gradient** (attribution) must flow back to original authors
- **Weights** (significant contributions) must be acknowledged
- **Bias terms** (specialized modifications) may be added with notice

---

## Article 4: Quantum-Classical Interface

### §4.1 Decoherence Boundary
This license exists at the **quantum-classical boundary**:
- **Quantum realm**: Ideas, algorithms, concepts (free to propagate)
- **Classical realm**: Copyright notices, attribution requirements (must be preserved)
- **Measurement**: When you publish/distribute, you collapse to classical compliance

### §4.2 Complementarity Principle
We embrace the **complementarity** of:
- **Open sharing** (wave nature of knowledge)
- **Proper attribution** (particle nature of authorship)
- You cannot violate both simultaneously

---

## Article 5: Quantum Error Correction

### §5.1 Logical Qubits
The **logical qubits** of this license are:
1. **Freedom** to use and modify
2. **Responsibility** to attribute
3. **Community** to share improvements
4. **Innovation** to push boundaries

### §5.2 Surface Code Protection
This license implements a **surface code** against bad faith:
- **X errors** (removing attribution) are detectable and correctable
- **Z errors** (adding restrictive terms) anti-commute with open source principles
- **The code distance** increases with community adoption

---

## Article 6: Training the Future

### §6.1 Loss Function
We optimize for:
- **Minimizing** barriers to scientific progress
- **Maximizing** innovation and collaboration
- **Regularizing** against proprietary enclosure
- **Validating** on real-world scientific impact

### §6.2 Epochs of Evolution
Each **epoch** (version) of this software:
- **Updates weights** (improves functionality)
- **Preserves architecture** (core principles)
- **May diverge** in specialized branches
- **Should converge** on better solutions

---

## Article 7: Quantum Supremacy of Spirit

### §7.1 No Quantum Advantage in Restriction
We assert that:
- **There is no quantum speedup** for restricting knowledge
- **Entanglement monotones** increase with sharing
- **Quantum volume** of community grows with openness
- **NISQ** (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) benefits from classical collaboration

### §7.2 Quantum Money Exception
If you create **quantum money** (significant commercial value) using this software:
- **Share a fraction** back to the community (encouraged but not required)
- **Acknowledge the foundation** (required)
- **Consider open-sourcing** improvements (quantum karma)

## Final State Vector

This license represents the **ground state** of a Hamiltonian that values:
- **Openness** over restriction
- **Collaboration** over competition  
- **Attribution** over anonymity
- **Progress** over profit
- **Quantum spirit** over classical limitation

**May your |ψ⟩ be entangled with greatness.**
